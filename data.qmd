## How to Download a CSV File to Your Computer

To download a data (CSV) file, click on the data set. Then click the `RAW` button. Now you should be able to right-click the dataset and save it. If you are using Safari on a Mac, make sure that the downloaded data does not have an extra *.txt* appended to it when it downloads. If it does, just delete the extra *.txt* suffix.
