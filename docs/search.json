    "text": "FAQs\nHow do I submit the assignment?\nCreate a PDF of your responses and submit the PDF via email to both the instructor and TA. Also cc any group members. Before you submit the assignment check that:\n\nAll group members‚Äô names are on the assignment.\nAll tables are numbered and have a caption.\nAll figures are numbered and have a caption.\nAll figures are re-sized to not take up more page space than is necessary to read them.\nNo R syntax is included unless the question specifically asked for the syntax to be included. If there is R syntax included, be sure that it is typeset in a monospaced font (e.g., Courier, Inconsolata).\nDo not submit the script file you used unless the directions specifically ask you to submit it.\n\nDo I need to turn in the script file?\nNo‚Ä¶unless the directions specifically ask you to submit the script file. The script file is for your reference. Future assignments will sometimes have questions that reference older assignments, so an organized and well-commented script file is a good idea. Moreover, the TA or myself may ask you to submit your syntax after you submit the assignment to help us interpret mistakes you made on the assignment so that we can provide more thorough feedback.\nWill you provide answer keys to the assignments?\nNo.¬†You will get back several comments on your assignments that address what you did wrong. The educational research is pretty clear that feedback is more helpful to student learning than providing correct answers. If you have further questions or need additional clarification, you are welcome to come to office hours or make an appointment with the instructor or TA.\nWill you go over the answers in class?\nNo.¬†I will address broad concepts if several students/groups made the same mistake, but otherwise, since each student/group makes unique mistakes going over the assignments more broadly is not a good use of our limited class time. The feedback should be helpful in understanding any mistakes you made, but if it isn‚Äôt, you are welcome to come to office hours or make an appointment with the instructor or TA.\nWill you look at our assignment prior to us submitting it?\nThe instructor or TA will not ‚Äúpre-grade‚Äù your assignment. If there is a ‚ÄúPreparation‚Äù part of the assignment we can ensure that you did that part correctly, and we can also give you feedback about syntax, but we will not tell you if an answer is correct or not. We can also answer clarifying questions (e.g., ‚ÄòI know Question 8 is asking about [‚Ä¶], but I‚Äôm not sure what this question is looking for. Is there another way to restate this question?‚Äô). If you completed the assignment without any trouble, then be confident in your work and simply submit the assignment! üòÑ If you are unsure about something specific, then ask about that specific thing rather than a general ‚Äòdid I do this right‚Äô!\nWill we be able to re-do the assignment?\nGenerally no. Since you have the opportunity to work in groups on the assignments, you should be able offset any of the issues that come up that would necessitate a re-submission. The exception to this is that we may allow you to re-do Assignment 1. If we do this, we will send you an email requesting that you resubmit part, or all of Assignment 1. You will not receive much feedback on your assignment prior to your re-submission. This is because during the first assignment you are learning not only content, but also expectations around how to respond to the questions we ask."

This variable (not salary) should be used in all analyses for Part I. Fit a regression model using teacher salaries to predict SAT scores.\n\nUsing symbols, write the null hypothesis that is tested by the F-statistic in this analysis.\nWrite no more than three sentences (to be included in a publication) that summarizes the results of the omnibus analysis. A summary of the results includes a written description of what is being tested by the F-test and the statistical results. At a minimum report the F-statistic, df, and p-value. A summary should also indicate what the statistical results suggest about the compatibility of the empirical data to the null hypothesis and what this means about the potential relationship between states‚Äô average teacher salaries and average SAT scores.\nUsing symbols, write the null hypothesis that is tested by the t-statistic for the slope.\nBased on the results of the t-test for the slope, are the empirical data consistent with the null hypothesis that the sample slope is entirely due to sampling error? Explain.\nCompute and interpret the 95% compatibility interval for the slope.\nCreate a plot that displays the regression line from the unstandardized regression analysis. This plot should also include a confidence envelope (uncertainty) for the regression line. Be sure to give your plot an appropriate caption.\n\n\n\nPart II: Centering a Predictor\nCenter the salary_thousand predictor by subtracting the mean teacher salary from each value. Call this new variable center_salary_thousand (e.g., centered_salary_thousand = salary_thousand - mean(salary_thousand)). This variable should be used in all analyses in Part II. Regress the SAT scores on the centered salaries.\n\nThe results of the F-test for this analysis are identical to the results of the F-test for the analysis in Part I. Explain why this is expected by referring to and comparing the hypothesis being tested in both sets of analyses.\nThe results of the t-test for the intercept in this analysis are different than the results of the t-test for the intercept in the analysis in Part I. Explain why this is expected by referring to and comparing the hypothesis being tested (and what that means) in both sets of analyses.\n\n\n\nPart III: Standardized Regression\nConvert the uncentered teacher salaries (salary_thousand) into z-scores by subtracting the mean salary and dividing by the standard deviation. Call this new variable z_salary (e.g., z_salary = (salary_thousand - mean(salary_thousand)) / sd(salary_thousand)). Also convert the SAT scores into z-scores and call that variable z_sat (e.g., z_sat = (sat - mean(sat)) / sd(sat)). Regress the SAT z-scores on the salary z-scores.\n\nThe p-value of the t-test for the intercept in this analysis is one. Explain why this is expected by referring to the hypothesis being tested in this analysis. (Hint: Think about what the intercept is and how that relates to what is being tested.)\n\n\n\nPart IV: Study Design and Causation\n\nThe test of the slope (regardless of analysis) suggests that teacher salaries seem to be related to SAT scores. Unfortunately this relationship is negative, indicating that higher teacher salaries are associated with lower SAT scores. A public-policy wonk wants to use this data to support the de-funding of public schools. Write a couple sentences that explain to this person why your analysis does not support this causal conclusion based on the study design. (Hint: Recall that inferring causation requires particular study designs. You may need to go back to your pre-requisite knowledge here.)"

The trifecta upon which that almost every university instructor is evaluated, and, ultimately compensated. One way in which academic administrators judge teaching quality is through teachers‚Äô course evaluations. While we know evaluation scores are not perfect measures of teaching quality, nonetheless, they do play a role in the tenure and promotion process. Unfortunately, many other non-teaching related factors are also associated with evaluation scores (e.g., professor‚Äôs ethnicity, professor‚Äôs sex).\nFor this part of the assignment, you will examine whether instructor attractiveness explains differences in course evaluation scores‚Äîand thus on earnings differences. To do so, you will use the data in the evaluations.csv file to fit a regression model that uses professors‚Äô beauty ratings to predict the variation in course evaluation ratings.\n\n[CSV]\n[Data Codebook]\n\nFit the regression model to predict the variation in course evaluation ratings using professors‚Äô beauty ratings.

The two semester sequence provides in-depth coverage of widely used statistical methods and models and prepares students for advanced statistical coursework. EPsy 8251 provides rigorous coverage of estimation and hypothesis testing with a particular focus on the General Linear Model. The roadmap for the course is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEPsy 8251 is a 3 credit course. It is expected that the academic work required of Graduate School and professional school students will exceed three hours per credit per week (see Expected Student Academic Work Policy). In my experience, it is typical for students to spend 10‚Äì15 hours a week on this course. As with every class, some students will spend more time than that on this course, while others will spend less time than that‚Äîit all depends on your prior experiences with statistics and computing. If you find yourself consistently spending more than 20 hours a week on the course, please make an appointment to see the instructor so that we can strategize about how to best optimize how you are devoting time to the course. \n\nA Note on Inclusion and Respect\nIn this class, we will work together to develop a learning community that is inclusive and respectful, and where every student is supported in the learning process. As a class full of diverse individuals (reflected by differences in race, culture, age, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, abilities, professional goals, and other social identities and life experiences) I expect that different students may need different things to support and promote their learning. The TAs and I will do everything we can to help with this, but as we only know what we know, we need you to communicate with us if things are not working for you or you need something we are not providing. I hope you all feel comfortable in helping to promote an inclusive classroom through respecting one another‚Äôs individual differences, speaking up, and challenging oppressive/problematic ideas. Finally, I look forward to learning from each of you and the experiences you bring to the class."

    "text": "Course Requirements and Grading\nStudents will complete eight homework assignments. The homework assignments and due dates will be posted on the Assignments page of the course website. These assignments include problems that will help you learn the course material through reflection and practice. Submit each assignment as a PDF file via email to the TA.\nTo foster cooperation and collaboration, you are permitted to form groups of no larger than three to work on the homework. Submit only one assignment per group, and list the names of each group member on the assignment. Each assignment will be scored and this score will be given to all individuals in the group. From past experience, student collaborations work most fluidly when everyone in the group has chosen the same grading option for the course (e.g., A/F, S/N, etc.).\nIf you work alone on the assignments, you need to truly work alone. To protect against running afoul of the scholastic dishonesty policy, students working alone are not permitted to interact with any other student in regards to the assignment, including discussion, obtaining help, etc."

    "text": "ChatGPT and Other AI\nArtificial intelligence (AI) language models, such as ChatGPT, may be used to help you write R syntax with appropriate citation, but not for answering any of the questions on the assignment. If you are in doubt as to whether you are using AI language models appropriately in this course, I encourage you to discuss your situation with me or the TA. Examples of citing AI language models are available at: https://libguides.umn.edu/chatgpt. You are responsible for ensuring any syntax composed by AI is correct.\n\n\nPolicy for Missing Class and Making up Missed/Late Work\nStudents are responsible for planning their schedules to avoid excessive conflicts with course requirements and must notify the instructor of unavoidable scheduling conflicts as early as possible. For circumstances where absences are unavoidable, accommodations for makeup work will be made according to University Policy. If you miss class:\n\nEmail the instructor as soon as you know you will be missing class.\nStudents are expected to obtain notes from a classmate of class material missed.\nPlease note that I will not be recording class sessions at the request of individual students, nor will I be Zooming students in to the class. Although, if you can arrange it with a classmate, they can Zoom you in.\n\nIf you are zooming in a classmate, please let the instructor know.\n\nIf you will be gone the day an assignment is due, you will need to make arrangements with the instructor about when you will turn in the assignment.\n\nIf you do not communicate with the instructor and make arrangements for turning in work when you are absent, the assignment will receive a 0.\n\n\n\nEvaluation of Student Performance\nCourse grades will be based entirely on performance on the homework assignments. The points from the eight homework assignment will be pooled to compute a percentage in the class, which will be converted to a final course grade using:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCutoff\nGrade\nDefinition for Graduate Credit\n\n\n\n\n93%‚Äì100%\nA\nFor exceptional work, well above the minimum criteria\n\n\n90%‚Äì92%\nA‚Äì\nFor outstanding work, well above the minimum criteria\n\n\n87%‚Äì89%\nB+\nFor excellent work, significant above the minimum criteria\n\n\n83%‚Äì86%\nB\nFor work above the minimum criteria\n\n\n80%‚Äì82%\nB‚Äì\n\n\n\n77%‚Äì79%\nC+\n\n\n\n73%‚Äì76%\nC\nFor work which meets the course requirements in every respect\n\n\n70%‚Äì72%\nC‚Äì\n\n\n\n63%‚Äì69%\nD\nWorthy of credit even though it fails to meet the course requirements\n\n\n0%‚Äì62%\nF\nFailed to meet minimum course requirements\n\n\n\nIf you are taking the course S/N, the minimum criterion to receive an S is 80% (the equivalent of a B‚Äì letter grade). The S grade does not carry grade points and is not part of the GPA calculation, but the credits will count toward the student‚Äôs degree program if allowed by the college, campus, or program.\nAny student who does not complete all homework assignments without making prior arrangements with the instructor will receive a grade of F/N.\n\n\n\nIncomplete\nInstructors may assign the registration symbol ‚ÄúI‚Äù for Incomplete if, at the time the incomplete is requested: (1) the student has successfully completed a substantial portion of the work of the course; and (2) due to extraordinary circumstances (as determined by the instructor), the student was prevented from completing the work of the course on time. The assignment of an ‚ÄúI‚Äù requires a written agreement with the student specifying the time and manner in which the student will complete the course requirements. For more information see Grading and Transcripts.\n\n\n\nAccessing Course Grades\nShortly after the course, you may access your grades online at myU. Assignments will be handed back in class or during office hours. Uncollected assignments will be retained for six weeks after the course and then discarded.\n\n\n\nStress Management\nStress management is an important piece of the skill set needed for success in graduate school. Pet Away Worry & Stress (PAWS) is one of the many resources available to students. Find out more at https://boynton.umn.edu/paws.\n\nYou can follow Tilly the Therapy Chicken on Twitter (@TherapyChicken)."

    "section": "Statistical Computing",
    "text": "Statistical Computing\nStatistical computing is an integral part of statistical work, and subsequently, EPsy 8251. To support your learning in this area, this course will emphasize the use of R. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS https://www.r-project.org. It should be noted that while some R syntax and programming is taught during class time, there is also a fair amount that you may need to learn on your own outside of class. There are several tutorials and resources linked from the course website to help you learn R.\nYou can install R and RStudio onto your local machine. (There are instructions for how to do this on the course website.) You are responsible for getting things to work on your computer. While it should be straightforward, each OS and computer has their quirks. I can try to help you with this if you are having trouble.\n\n\nTechnology Policy\nThe course uses technology on a regular basis during both instruction and assessments (e.g., homework assignments, exams, etc.). Student difficulty with obtaining or operating the various software programs and technologies‚Äîincluding printer trouble‚Äîwill not be acceptable as an excuse for late work. Due to the variation in computer types and systems, the instructor or TA may not be able to assist in trouble shooting all problems you may have.\n\n\n\n\nCEHD Policy on Recording Classes\nAll class sessions may be recorded by the instructor using the procedures in the CEHD Policy on Recording Classes, with or without prior notice. Students should assume that a class session is being recorded unless otherwise notified. No person (student or otherwise) may record a class without express written permission from the instructor or an authorized administrator implementing a disability accommodation. All permitted recordings are governed by this policy‚Äôs limits on distribution and redistribution of recordings."

Students are free to take reasoned exception to the views offered in any course of study and to reserve judgment about matters of opinion, but they are responsible for learning the content of any course of study for which they are enrolled.1 Reports of concerns about academic freedom are taken seriously, and there are individuals and offices available for help. Contact the instructor (Andrew Zieffler; zief0002@umn.edu), the Department Chair (Anne Foegen; afoegen@umn.edu), your adviser, the associate dean of the college (Tabitha Grier-Reed; grier001@umn.edu), or the Vice Provost for Faculty and Academic Affairs in the Office of the Provost (Beth Lewis; blewis@umn.edu)."

    "text": "Should more money be spent on public schools or should that money be spent elsewhere? Both sides of this ongoing public debate have been argued passionately, using a multitude of anecdotal evidence. Although we will not settle this debate, we will examine data akin to the types of data that policy makers use to make funding decisions. Specifically, we will examine whether teacher salaries are related to SAT scores at the state level.\nThis goal of this assignment is to give you more experience fitting and interpreting regression models. In this assignment, you will use the data from the file state-education.csv to examine the relationship between teacher salaries and student total SAT scores at the state level.\n\n[CSV]\n[Data Codebook]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart I: Unstandardized Regression\nBefore carrying out any analyses, create a predictor called salary_thousand that indicates the average state salary in thousands of dollars (e.g., if salary = 52143; salary_thousand = 52.143). This variable (not salary) should be used in all analyses for Part I. Fit a regression model using teacher salaries to predict SAT scores.\n\nUsing symbols, write the null hypothesis that is tested by the F-statistic in this analysis.\nWrite no more than three sentences (to be included in a publication) that summarizes the results of the omnibus analysis. A summary of the results includes a written description of what is being tested by the F-test and the statistical results. At a minimum report the F-statistic, df, and p-value. A summary should also indicate what the statistical results suggest about the compatibility of the empirical data to the null hypothesis and what this means about the potential relationship between states‚Äô average teacher salaries and average SAT scores.\nUsing symbols, write the null hypothesis that is tested by the t-statistic for the slope.\nBased on the results of the t-test for the slope, are the empirical data consistent with the null hypothesis that the sample slope is entirely due to sampling error? Explain.\nCompute and interpret the 95% compatibility interval for the slope.\nCreate a plot that displays the regression line from the unstandardized regression analysis. This plot should also include a confidence envelope (uncertainty) for the regression line. Be sure to give your plot an appropriate caption.\n\n\n\nPart II: Centering a Predictor\nCenter the salary_thousand predictor by subtracting the mean teacher salary from each value. Call this new variable center_salary_thousand (e.g., centered_salary_thousand = salary_thousand - mean(salary_thousand)). This variable should be used in all analyses in Part II. Regress the SAT scores on the centered salaries.\n\nThe results of the F-test for this analysis are identical to the results of the F-test for the analysis in Part I. Explain why this is expected by referring to and comparing the hypothesis being tested in both sets of analyses.\nThe results of the t-test for the intercept in this analysis are different than the results of the t-test for the intercept in the analysis in Part I. Explain why this is expected by referring to and comparing the hypothesis being tested (and what that means) in both sets of analyses.\n\n\n\nPart III: Standardized Regression\nConvert the uncentered teacher salaries (salary_thousand) into z-scores by subtracting the mean salary and dividing by the standard deviation. Call this new variable z_salary (e.g., z_salary = (salary_thousand - mean(salary_thousand)) / sd(salary_thousand)). Also convert the SAT scores into z-scores and call that variable z_sat (e.g., z_sat = (sat - mean(sat)) / sd(sat)). Regress the SAT z-scores on the salary z-scores.\n\nThe p-value of the t-test for the intercept in this analysis is one. Explain why this is expected by referring to the hypothesis being tested in this analysis. (Hint: Think about what the intercept is and how that relates to what is being tested.)\n\n\n\nPart IV: Study Design and Causation\n\nThe test of the slope (regardless of analysis) suggests that teacher salaries seem to be related to SAT scores. Unfortunately this relationship is negative, indicating that higher teacher salaries are associated with lower SAT scores. A public-policy wonk wants to use this data to support the de-funding of public schools. Write a couple sentences that explain to this person why your analysis does not support this causal conclusion based on the study design. (Hint: Recall that inferring causation requires particular study designs. You may need to go back to your pre-requisite knowledge here.)"

Based on the Microsoft and FCC estimates, does it seem that the FCC estimates (which are provided by the ISPs) are ‚Äúoverestimating‚Äù America‚Äôs broadband access? Explain.\nYes. The FCC estimates are higher than the Microsoft estimates in every single state! Moreover, this overestimate is quite large at an average of 0.461.\n\n6. Using the Microsoft estimates, which states have the best and worst broadband access based on the means? Which states are the most and least homogenous (across counties) in terms of their broadband access?\nIn terms of the means, New Jersey has the highest average broadband usage (\\(M=0.67\\)) and Mississippi has the lowest average broadband usage (\\(M=0.12\\)). Virginia is the most heterogeneous state in broadband usage (\\(SD=0.26\\)) while Rhode Island is the most homogenous (\\(SD = 0.04\\)). (Technically Washington DC is the most homogenous as they are composed of a single county.)\n\n# Highest and lowest mean\nstate_broadband |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(M_microsoft)) |&gt;\n  select(M_microsoft) |&gt;\n  filter(row_number() %in% c(1, 50))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Highest and lowest sd\nstate_broadband |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(SD_microsoft)) |&gt;\n  select(SD_microsoft) |&gt;\n  filter(row_number() %in% c(1, 50))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n7.

Use ggplot() to create a scatterplot of the relationship between the proportion of users with access to broadband and the proportion of people living in poverty using the state-level data. (Put the proportion living in poverty on the x-axis.) Change the axis labels so that both the x- and y-axis have labels that suitably describe the variables being plotted. (For help on this, read the Axes page of the Cookbook for R website.) Include this plot in a word-processed document. Resize the plot so it does not take up any more space than necessary. Finally, give your figure a name (e.g., Figure 1) and an appropriate caption.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: Scatterplot of the proportion of average users in each state with access to broadband and the proportion of people living in poverty.\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Based on these data, describe the relationship between poverty and broadband access.\nThere is a negative relationship in these data. States with higher proportions of people living in poverty have a lower proportion of people using broadband speed internet.\n\n10. Identify Minnesota on your plot. (You do not have to use R to do this; you can use an image editor, or do it by hand.) You can either create a new plot or just include Minnesota on the plot you include for Question 8.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Scatterplot of the proportion of average users in each state with access to broadband and the proportion of people living in poverty. Minnesota is marked in blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n11. Based on its location in the plot, how does Minnesota compare to the other states in terms of broadband access? What about in terms of poverty? Explain.\nCompared to other states, Minnesota has a lower proportion of people living in poverty (it is on the left-side of the plot; below the overall mean). It also has a slightly lower proportion of people using broadband speed internet than the average across all states, but it is quite similar to the mean."

    "text": "Model 3: Interpreting Results from the ‚ÄúFinal‚Äù Model\nThe research literature suggests that all three predictors are substantively important in predicting variation in fertility rates. Moreover, from the CIs produced in Model 3, we see that all three effects included in the model are statistically relevant (none of the CIs span 0). Because of this, we will adopt Model 3 as our ‚Äúfinal‚Äù model. Use the results from Model 3 to answer the remainder of the questions on this assignment.\n\nReport the regression equation from fitting Model 3. Use Equation Editor (or some other program that correctly types mathematical expressions) to typeset the equation correctly.\nUsing output from the ANOVA table, compute and report the value for the model \\(R^2\\). Show your work for full credit.\nInterpret the value of the model \\(R^2\\) using the context of the data.\nUsing symbols, write the omnibus null hypothesis that is tested by the model-level F-statistic in this analysis in two different manners: (1) using the coefficient parameters used in the regression model, and (2) using the variance accounted for parameter.\nBased on the results of the model-level F-test, does the model seem to explain variation in fertility rates? Explain. Note: Here you can use the p-value as evidence, but do not compare this to 0.05.\nInterpret the estimated coefficient value associated with the partial effect of contraception.\nBased on the 95% confidence interval for the partial effect of contraception on fertility rate, which parameter values are reasonably compatible with the empirical data? Explain what this implies about the magnitude of the partial effect.\nCreate a publication quality plot that displays the results from Model 3. For this plot, put the contraception predictor on the x-axis. Control out the effect of education level by setting this to the mean level of education. Display two separate lines to show the effect of infant mortality rate; a small and large rate based on the data. The two lines should be displayed using different linetypes or colors (or both) so that they can be easily differentiated in the plot. Be sure that the figure is appropriately captioned. (2pts.)"

The two semester sequence provides in-depth coverage of widely used statistical methods and models and prepares students for advanced statistical coursework. EPsy 8251 provides rigorous coverage of estimation and hypothesis testing with a particular focus on the General Linear Model. The roadmap for the course is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEPsy 8251 is a 3 credit course. It is expected that the academic work required of Graduate School and professional school students will exceed three hours per credit per week (see Expected Time per Course Credit Policy). In my experience, it is typical for students to spend 10‚Äì15 hours a week on this course. As with every class, some students will spend more time than that on this course, while others will spend less time than that‚Äîit all depends on your prior experiences with statistics and computing. If you find yourself consistently spending more than 20 hours a week on the course, please make an appointment to see the instructor so that we can strategize about how to best optimize how you are devoting time to the course. \n\nA Note on Inclusion and Respect\nIn this class, we will work together to develop a learning community that is inclusive and respectful, and where every student is supported in the learning process. As a class full of diverse individuals (reflected by differences in race, culture, age, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, abilities, professional goals, and other social identities and life experiences) I expect that different students may need different things to support and promote their learning. The TAs and I will do everything we can to help with this, but as we only know what we know, we need you to communicate with us if things are not working for you or you need something we are not providing. I hope you all feel comfortable in helping to promote an inclusive classroom through respecting one another‚Äôs individual differences, speaking up, and challenging oppressive/problematic ideas. Finally, I look forward to learning from each of you and the experiences you bring to the class."
